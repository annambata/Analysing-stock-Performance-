# Stock Data Analysis and Visualization for Investment Insights

## Project Overview
In this project, I assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm that specializes in helping customers make informed stock investments. My task is to gather and analyze financial data from popular stocks, including Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop. Using Python libraries and web scraping techniques, I extracted key financial metrics such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports. The collected data was then visualized in a dashboard to identify potential patterns and trends, providing valuable insights for investment decisions.

## The Challenge
For investors, understanding stock performance is critical to making informed decisions. The challenge is to collect and process real-time and historical financial data, then create meaningful visualizations that reveal trends and patterns over time. This project involves automating data extraction and analysis to streamline the decision-making process for investors.

## Goal and Objective
The goal of this project is to build an automated pipeline for extracting and analyzing stock data, ultimately delivering actionable insights through data visualization. The main objectives are:

- Extract financial data such as historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports for selected stocks.
- Clean and process the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Visualize the data in a dashboard, highlighting trends, patterns, and potential investment opportunities.
- Identify insights that can aid the firmâ€™s investment strategy for its clients.
